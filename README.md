Overview
Savr is a web app designed specifically for New Zealand cafés to reduce food waste and improve kitchen efficiency. By tracking inventory expiry dates, sending timely notifications, suggesting recipes using ingredients that are about to expire, and recommending batch sizes based on recent sales trends, the app empowers café staff to make smarter, more sustainable decisions.

What problem does it solve?
Many cafés struggle with unintentional waste due to expired ingredients and unsold items. This leads to unnecessary waste, increased costs, and environmental impact. Savr solves this problem by offering a simple yet powerful tool that ensures ingredients are used efficiently and waste is minimised. By giving staff visibility into what’s about to expire and offering suggestions on how to use those items, it reduces the likelihood of waste and helps cafés operate more sustainably.

Key features
Users can add and manage inventory items by entering key information like name, quantity, and expiry date. The app automatically lists items that are close to expiring, making it easy for staff to prioritise their use. It sends notifications each day for a week before it expires, so no ingredient goes unnoticed. When an item is nearing expiry, the app can suggest recipes that include that ingredient, making it easier to incorporate into the café’s menu. Premium members can enter recent sales data to receive batch size recommendations, helping avoid both overproduction and understocking.

Limitations
Currently, inventory items and sales data must be entered manually. Connecting to a point of sales system is not yet integrated but planned for a future release. Recipe suggestions are generated from a predefined database and may not always align with a café’s unique menu or dietary preferences.
